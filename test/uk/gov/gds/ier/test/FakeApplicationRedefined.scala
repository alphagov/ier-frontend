/**
 * Intended as an extension to TestHelpers; every test using FakeApplication also extends
 * TestHelpers so changes here have broad impact.
 *
 * This is a workaround to know issue with inability to set mocks to FakeApplication for individual
 * tests. First test calling FakeApplication also sets injected implementations for all downstream
 * test in the suite. That makes testing unpredictable, dependent on the test order!
 *
 * Whatever FakeApplication test is run first, sets this one test context, hence predicable results
 * whatever the order. Having not been able to set different mocks for individual tests is a
 * limitation, but at least there is the option to define behaviour dynamically in this trait.
 *
 * Locate service is emulated, with few (semi) realistic results (test config is ignored)
 * IER-API client submit against real service, based on test config settings
