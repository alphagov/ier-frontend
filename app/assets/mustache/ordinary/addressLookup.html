          If you can't find your postcode on a letter or other document, try entering your address 
          into a search engine website.
        </p>
        <h3>I don't know what address to use</h3>
        <h4>If you have more than one address</h4>
        <p>
          It's sometimes possible to register at two addresses (though you can only vote once in 
          any election).
        </p>
        <p>
          For example, if you're a student living away from home, you may be able to register at 
          both your home and term time addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you want to register at two addresses, make two separate applications through this 
          service. Your local Electoral Registration Office will look at each application and tell 
          you whether you're allowed to register.
        </p>
        <h4>If you don't have a permanent address</h4>
        <p>
          If you're homeless and living in temporary accommodation (for example, a long term
          hostel), use that address.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a long term patient in a psychiatric hospital, use the address of the hospital.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a prisoner on long term remand, use the address of the prison.
        </p>
        <h4>If you can't provide an address</h4>
        <p>
          If you can't provide an address, contact 
          [your local Electoral Registration Office](https://www.gov.uk/get-on-electoral-register) 
          for advice.
