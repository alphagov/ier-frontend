        <h2>Help with proxy or postal voting</h2>
        <p>If this is your first time voting by proxy or post, or your details have changed, you’ll need to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Complete and sign a form</li>
            <li>Return it by email or post to {{authority}}</li>
        </ol>

        <p>You can scan the form and <strong>return it by email</strong>, as long as all of its parts are visible and the signature is clear,
            or your vote may not be counted.</p>

        <p><strong>Voting by proxy</strong> - If you are unable to vote in person, someone you trust who’s registered to vote, can vote for you.
            Your proxy can either go to your local polling station to vote on your behalf, or can apply to vote for you by post.
            Voting by proxy can be useful particularly if you are living in a country too far away to send back a postal vote on time for an election.</p>

        <p><strong>Voting by post</strong> - We’ll send your postal vote to the address you choose. Then you fill it in and return it by post.
            Ballot papers for the EU referendum will be sent out from around a month before the referendum date.
            If you don’t think that there will be enough time to receive and return your ballot paper on time,
            you may want to consider appointing a proxy to vote on your behalf.</p>
