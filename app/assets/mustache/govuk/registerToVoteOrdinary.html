  <p>Use this service to apply to register to vote.</p>
  <p>You only need to register once - you don't need to register separately for every election.</p>
  <p>You must register again if you've changed address, name or nationality.</p>
  <p>You can also use this service to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>change the way you vote, for example in person, by post or by proxy</li>
    <li>get on or off the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/electoral-register">open register</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>It usually takes about 5 minutes.</p>
  <div role="note" aria-label="Information"
       style="margin-top: 2em; background: none; border-left: 10px solid #bfc1c3;
       margin-bottom: 1em; padding: 1em 0 0.1em 1em;">
    <p>This service is also available <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cofrestru-i-bleidleisio">in Welsh (Cymraeg)</a>.</p>
  </div>
  <p>You may need the following, if you have them:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>your National Insurance number</li>
    <li>your passport if you're a British citizen living abroad</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You need to be on the electoral register to vote in elections and referendums.</p>

  </p>

  <h2>Before you start</h2>
  <p>You can also <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/voter-registration-forms-paper-versions">register by post.</a></p>
  <p>You can't register to vote if you're in the UK illegally.</p>

  <h2>Public servants posted overseas</h2>
  <p>There are separate registration services for public servants who are likely to be posted overseas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/register-to-vote/crown">Crown servants</a> (for example members of the diplomatic service or overseas civil service)</li>
    <li><a href="/register-to-vote/crown">British Council employees</a></li>
    <li><a href="/register-to-vote/forces">armed forces</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>You should also use these registration services if you're the spouse or civil partner of a public servant posted overseas.</p>
  <p>You can still <a href="{{startUrl}}">register as a non-service voter</a> if you're in the armed forces and have a permanent home address in the UK.</p>

  <h2>Northern Ireland</h2>
  <p>This service is for England, Wales and Scotland only. You'll need to register using a different form if you live in <a href="http://www.eoni.org.uk/Register-To-Vote/Register-to-vote-change-address-change-name">Northern Ireland</a></p>
