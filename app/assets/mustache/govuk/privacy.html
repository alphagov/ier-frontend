  <p>After you send your application, it goes through several checks to make sure you’re entitled to register.</p>
  <p>
    1. This online service is run by HM Government. We may share your name, date of birth and National Insurance
    number with government departments so they can check your details against their records and make sure they are
    genuine. We process your application in line with the law, including the
    <a href="http://ico.org.uk/for_organisations/data_protection/the_guide/the_principles" rel="external">Data Protection Act 1998</a>.
    This means, for example, that won’t share your information with anyone else unless we’re required to do so by law.
  </p>

  <p>
    2. Your application is forwarded to your local Electoral Registration Office. They look at the information
    you’ve provided and check that you’re entitled to register. If they have any questions about your application,
    they will contact you. They may also check your immigration status with the Home Office.
  </p>

  <p>
    3. Once the checks are complete, the Electoral Registration Office will add your name and address to the
    electoral register as part of the next monthly update.
  </p>

  <h2>How your local Electoral Registration Office will handle your information</h2>
  <p>
    Like other public bodies, each Electoral Registration Office has a personal information charter setting out the
    standards it will follow when processing, storing and sharing your personal information.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, they may share information with the Electoral Commission or the police if they think it could help
    to prevent or detect crime (for example, fraud).

    to get a copy of their personal information charter.
