</h2>

<h3>What happens to my application now?
</h3>
<p>
    For your application to register to vote to be successful, the Electoral Registration Officer must verify your identity. The Electoral Registration Officer will then contact you to confirm whether you have been registered to vote successfully or whether you need to provide further information.
</p>

<div>
    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="How do I know if my application has been successful?">
        <p>
            You will receive a letter or an email confirming that your application has been successful and that your details will be included on the next update to the electoral register.  If the Electoral Registration Officer requires further information to verify your identity then they will either send you a letter or an email.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="When will my details appear on the register?">

        <p>
            The Electoral Registration Officer must publish a new register by 1 December every year unless there is a by election in your local authority area in which case they may delay publishing the new register until 1 February the following year.
        </p>

        <p>
            This is then followed by monthly updates published on the first working day of the month throughout January to September. There are no monthly updates for October and November.
        </p>

        <p>
            If there is an election or referendum in your area at any stage of the year, this will be supplemented by a further three published updates on the lead up to the election.
        </p>

        <p>
            Depending on when your completed application is successfully submitted will determine when your details appear on the register.  The table below details the deadline for each register update:

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="What happens if I submit my application on time before a deadline but its then unsuccessful?">

        <p>If you successfully submit your application before the deadline but are required to provide documentary evidence or an attestation to verify your identity, then you have a further five days after the deadline to submit the documents as required.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="How do you verify my identity?">

        <p><b>If you have provided your name, date of birth and national insurance number  -  </b>these will be matched against your records held at the Department for Work and Pensions and local authority held records.  If they match the Electoral Registration Officer can be confident of your identity and unless there are any other concerns, your application to register to vote will be successful.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="What happens if my details don’t match with DWP or local records? Or what if I can’t provide my date of birth or national insurance number?">

        <p>In either scenario,  the Electoral Registration Officer must verify your identity by another method.  These will be as follows:</p>

        <p><b>Requesting documentary evidence</b><br>
            The Electoral Registration Officer will contact you, usually by post or email, requesting you provide documentary evidence to prove your identity. The full list will be provided with the documentary evidence request but includes forms of ID such as a passport and driving license.
        </p>

        <p><b>Requesting an attestation</b><br>
            If you are unable to provide any documentary evidence relating to your identity then please contact the Electoral Registration Officer.  Their details will be on the documentary evidence request letter.  You will then be invited to submit an attestation.  This is where you ask someone you know, who is not part of your immediate family to sign a declaration confirming your identity.  The person you ask to do this must be registered to vote themselves and must be of ‘good standing’ in the community.   The Electoral Registration Officer will provide you with the attestation application including the declaration.
        </p>

        <p><b>Your application to register to vote will not be successful until you have provided the documentary evidence or attestation as required.

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="What is the deadline for registering to vote before an election?">


        <p>
            You must submit your online registration application before midnight twelve days before the election day.  If you submit your application after this point then you will not be able to vote at the election.
            (****This section to be updated with specific dates for national polls when required****)

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="Are there certain elections which I need to register separately for?">
        </h3>

        <p><b>You do not need to re-register for each election or referendum.</b>  If you receive a poll card for your address then you are currently registered and able to vote in the upcoming election or referendum.
        </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="When do I need to re-register?">

        <p>You only need to re-register if you move house, change your name or your nationality changes.

    <br><br>
    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="How do I know whether I’m eligible to vote in different elections?">

        <p>The franchise does vary for different elections. For example, you must be a British, qualifying Commonwealth or Irish citizen aged 18 or over on 8 June 2017 to vote in the UK General Election.

            <br><br>Students can register to vote at their term time and home address and may vote at local elections from both addresses. But they are only allowed to vote from one of these addresses at a national election. Please see the following webpage for more details [insert link]
        </p>
    </div>
    <br><br>


    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="What is the poll card for?">

        <p>Before each election, if you are on the electoral register, you will be sent a poll card approximately six weeks before the poll.  If you do not receive a poll card then you may not be on the electoral register.  You should contact your local Electoral Registration Officer to find out.

            <br><br>If you apply close to the deadline for a local or national poll, there is a chance that you will receive your poll card before you receive the letter or email confirming that your application was successful. The poll card does also confirm, though, that you are on the register for the forthcoming election.

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="During my application I said I want to vote by post - what happens now?">
        </h3>

        <p>
            You must complete a separate application to vote by post.  This cannot be online but must instead be completed by hand on a paper application.  This is because part of the postal voting application process  includes matching your signature on your original application and your returned postal voting statement (which you send back with the ballot paper).

            <br><br>You will receive the application either by post or email, depending on what you requested in your application.  If you have not received this within two weeks, then please contact your local Electoral Registration Officer.  You can alternatively download a form from:
            https://www.yourvotematters.co.uk/how-do-i-vote/voting-by-post

            <br><br>You need to complete the application and return it to the local Electoral Registration Officer in order to be granted a postal vote.

    <br><br><br>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="What is a proxy vote?">

        <p>
            If you are unable to attend your polling station to vote and you are unable to or do not want a postal vote, then you can appoint a proxy. This is someone who you appoint to vote on your behalf.

            <br><br>They will have to attend your allocated polling station to cast your vote or they can apply to cast your vote by post.

            <br><br>However, at election time, the postal vote deadline is before the proxy vote deadline.  This means that the will be a few days where you can still appoint a proxy but they would only be able to cast your vote in person at your allocated polling station.  Please see your local authority website for deadline dates on the lead up to an election.

    <br>
    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="I am a student. Can I register at my home and term time addresses?">

        <p>
            As a student you are entitled to register at both your home address and your term time address.  Simply complete an application for each address.  You may vote at local elections from both addresses. <b>But you are not allowed to vote a national election, such as a General Election at both addresses.  It is an offence to vote twice at a national election, so in this circumstance you would need to chose where you are going to vote.</b>
        </p>

    </div>
    <br><br>

    <div class="help-content page-help-content" data-toggle-text="I split my time between two properties. Where should I register?">

        <p>

You may vote at local elections from both addresses. But you are not allowed to vote a national election, such as a General Election at both addresses.  It is an offence to vote twice at a national election, so in this circumstance you would need to chose where you are going to vote.
            <br><br>If you own a second property but do not live there for approximately 6 months of the year, then you are not entitled to register to vote at that property.
