    <h2>Sorry, you can’t register to vote without a date of birth</h2>
    <p>Try to find out your date of birth: you can only register to vote at 16 or 17 if you can provide an exact date of birth.</p>
    <p>Or try to register again once you’re 18. You can register at 18 without an exact date of birth, as long as you can provide a genuine reason why you don’t know it.</p>
